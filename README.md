# hamlet
How About Machine Learning Enhancing Theses? - a pilot discovery project

Hamlet will prototype various machine-learning-driven interfaces to the [MIT thesis collection](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/7582), in order to explore the possibilities in this space and also promote engagement with MIT research. It builds on smaller-scale explorations of word2vec and MIT thesis data ([code](https://github.com/MITLibraries/mundaneum), [blog posts](https://mitlibraries.github.io/ml2s)).
